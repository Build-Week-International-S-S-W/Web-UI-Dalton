        <h3>We Believe</h2>
        <p>Children have been endowed by their creator with the inalienable right to be reared in a family. Thats why we make a difference in the lives of Ghanaian children by providing them with a place they can call home: a temporary home that includes food, shelter and physical, mental and emotional nurturing while trying to reintegrate them with their biological family or find them a new adoptive family.</p>

          <h3>Our Goal</h2>
          <p>Our goal is to always be, pound for pound, the most impactful place you can put a dollar. Thats because, we shelter and reintegrate some of the most vulnerable children in this world and we run our operations using sound business practices, operating on donations and volunteer efforts from people like you so 100% of every dollar goes directly to the cause. Anyone can make a difference at GMAD.</p>
